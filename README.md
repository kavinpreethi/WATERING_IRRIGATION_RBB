Please email Dr Kavin Narasimhan (k.narasimhan@surrey.ac.uk) or Prof. Nigel Gilbert (n.gilbert@surrey.ac.uk) for comments/queries. WATERING_IRRIGATION_RBB is a sub-model of the WATER user associations at the Interface of Nexus Governance (WATERING) model (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nqs9ak2nY). WATERING allows exploring the impact of community-based water governance on water availability, water use and economic productivity within an irrigation scheme.
